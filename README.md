# sams_surf_shop
Codecademy's intermediate Python project for unit testing.

This is a good challenge for utilizing your unit testing skills above and beyond a generic level… and by that, I mean on an OOP level. Working with classes and objects within this framework is really tough, but overall, it provides useful tools to put in your software development arsenal.

In Sam’s shop, you have a shopping cart (held in the ShoppingCart class), and within this “cart”, you can buy or rent up to 5 surf boards. For each board you buy or rent, a message is returned that says something to the effect of, “You have added x board(s) to your cart”. If you add more than 5 boards an error occurs and if your stuff sits in the cart too long, then you will also get an error. Lastly, bonus points are awarded in the form of a discount if you’re a “local”.

The project requires that we test the code for bugs by constructing all the tests in the “tests.py” file (on GitHub the file is called, "test_surfshop.py").
